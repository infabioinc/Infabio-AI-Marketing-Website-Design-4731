# ðŸ”§ Build Error Fix - Terser Dependency

## Issue Fixed
**Error**: `terser not found. Since Vite v3, terser has become an optional dependency`

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. Added Terser Dependency
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "terser": "^5.19.2"
  }
}
```

### 2. Optimized Vite Configuration
- Enhanced terser options for better compression
- Improved code splitting and chunking
- Better performance optimization

### 3. Build Commands
```bash
# Clean install with terser
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Preview the build
npm run preview
```

## ðŸš€ What's Fixed
- âœ… Terser dependency added
- âœ… Build process optimized
- âœ… Better code compression
- âœ… Improved performance
- âœ… Console logs removed in production

## Alternative: No-Minification Build
If you want to avoid terser completely, you can also use:

```javascript
// In vite.config.js
build: {
  minify: false  // Disables terser completely
}
```

But the current setup with terser will give you:
- Smaller bundle sizes
- Better performance
- Production-ready optimization

## Deploy Now
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The build should now complete successfully! ðŸŽ‰
